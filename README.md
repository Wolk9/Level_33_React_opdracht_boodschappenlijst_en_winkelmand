# GroceryList and ShoppingCart Assiginment - Martin de Bes / WINC Academy

In this assignment I have learned how to apply my React knwoledge so far. By far the **Lift up State** principle took a while to comprehend.

### Teach the Teacher

I have managed to coop with the Lifting up State difficulties by forcing myself to write a tutorial so that I had to be able to explain the principle to others. I have used an analogy of Donald Duck and his nevews who are exchanging moods and number of coins. You can see the tutorial here:

and the code working in a sandbox here:

## Design

I have taken designing the app seriously and tried to make it eyecandy. I have used FontAwsome icon's to fancy it up.
